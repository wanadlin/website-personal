	<h3><h3 style="color:red"> About Myself</h3>
	<center><h4 style="color:black"> Hello everyone! My name is Wan Nur Adlin Bt Wan Ab Aziz. 
		My nickname is Elyn. 
		I was born on February 10 1997, I am 23 years old. 
		I was living in Kota Bharu Kelantan with my big family. 
	    I am the youngest of eight siblings. I am a student UITM Machang in Bachelor of Office System Management.
	    Before I continued my studies, I worked part-time at a restaurant in a mall for three months as a waiteress.
	    My experience working there is always facing various customer grievances that are always right. 
	    Apart from that too, I learned how to communicate well with customers. Furthermore, I also learned the basics of making dessert.
	     I enjoy working in restaurants because from there I can meet various people and also meet foreigners, from there I improve the way my communicate in English. 
	     For this semester, once again I am studying classes online because to avoid the COVID-19 epidemic that is now becoming more prevalent. 
	     Every student and lecturer makes extensive use of online learning sessions. For me, studying online can also learn a lot in terms of using technologies such as Google Meet, Classroom, Webex Meet and etc. In addition, the challenge for a student should be more diligent to better understand each subject and research for more information because online learning is not the same as face-to-face learning. 
	     During ODL,I provide my study desk space by decorating beautifully so that, I am more comfortable and focused when studying online. Furthermore, ODL can also save money for students because studying from home. But students only need to spend money on internet topup.</h4>

<center><h4 style="color:black"> Lastly about myself, for this second semester is more challenging than last semester. So, I have to study harder so that I can achieve better results. Because learning online is very different from learning face to face. The challenge I always face is in terms of understanding, internet problems and have to work hard to find out information such as assignments given by the lecturer. In addition, always be punctual in doing work so that work is not delayed. In addition, my friends also helped me a lot in completing assignments and giving me guidance. Finally, my parents also gave me a lot of support and encouragement to continue to be passionate about learning online. Hopefully the COVID-19 epidemic can reduce the spread to the community so that we can be free as usual.</h4>
