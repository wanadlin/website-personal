<font color="black" size="3" face="arial">My name is Wan Nur Adlin Bt Wan Ab Aziz.My nickname is Elyn. I was born on February 10 1997, I was 24 years old. I was living in Kota Bharu Kelantan with my big family. I am the youngest of eight siblings. I am a student Uitm Machang in Bachelor of Office System Management. Before I continued my studies, I worked part time at a restaurant in a mall for three months as a waitress. My experience working there is facing various customers grievances that are always right. Apart from that too. I learned how to communicate well with customers. Furthermore, I also learned the basics of making dessert. I enjoy working in restaurant. So from there I can meet various people and also meet foreigners. From there, I can improve the way my communication in English. For this semester, once again I am studying classes online because to avoid the COVID-19 epidemic that is now becoming more prevalent. Every student and lecturer makes extensive use of online learning sessions. For me, studying online can also learn a lot in terms of using technologies such as Google Meet, Classroom,Webex Meet and etc. In addition, the challenge for a student should be more diligent to better understand each subject and research for more information because online learning not the same as face-to-face learning. During ODL, I provide my study desk space by decorating beautifully. So that, I am more comfortable and focused when studying online. Furthermore, ODL can also save money for students because studying from home. But students only need to spend money on internet topup.</font></p>

<font color="black" size="3" face="arial">Lastly about myself for this second semester is more challenging than last semester. So, I have to study harder to achieve better results.Because learning online is very different from learning face-to-face. The challenge that I have to facing is understanding in subjects. Besides that, I also to facing internet connection problem. In addition, my friends also helped me a lot in completing assignments and giving me guidance.Finally, my parents also give me a lot of support and encouragement to continue to be passionate about learning online. Hopefully, the COVID-19 epidemic can reduce the spread to the community. So that, we can be free as usual.</font></p>
