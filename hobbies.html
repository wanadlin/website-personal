<center><font color="black" size="5" face="Arial"> Travelling is one of my favorite hobbies. I like all kinds of travel by car, by train, by plane and also travelling by ship.This picture shows me and my family vacationing in Singapore in October last year for 2 days 1 night. On the first day our family visited a place in Gardens by the Bay. While the second day we as a family visited a place at Universal Studio Singapore (USS) as pictured above. We stayed at Thad's Boutique Hostel for one night.This holiday is very amazing for me and my family because of the many experiences and challenges such as visiting high places because I am a person who is afraid of heights for me it is a rather challenging experience for me to go through the moments of this holiday. Meanwhile, toys such as Roller Coster various types of themes such as The Mummy, Transformer, Sherk etc.</font></center>
